# IoT Metrics

An IoT metrics service exposing both REST and gRPC APIs on port 8080 (default).

- **REST**
  - [OpenAPI spec](openapi.yaml)
  - Implements handlers using [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com)
- **gRPC**
  - [Protobuf schema](proto/iot/v1/service.proto)
  - Implements handlers using [Connect](https://connectrpc.com)
  - Connect handlers support the full gRPC wire format out of the box

## System Design

#### Handlers

- REST and gRPC handlers are implemented separately to align with the assignment requirements.
  - üí°Ô∏è While I could have unified them under a single Connect handler and used
    [gRPC-Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway)
    or [Vanguard](https://github.com/connectrpc/vanguard-go) for REST to gRPC transcoding, I chose not to, as that
    would go against the intent of the assignment.

#### Data store

- SQLite is used as the data store, but alternatives (e.g. in-memory, Postgres, etc.) can be supported by simply
  implementing the `device.Repository` interface.

#### Logging

- Requests are automatically logged via middleware. In addition, dedicated logs are recorded for:
  - Device configuration updates
  - Recorded device metrics
  - Triggered alerts

#### Alerting

- Alerts are triggered synchronously within the `POST /devices/:device_id/metrics` handler. After a metric is recorded,
  thresholds are checked and an alert is triggered if any are breached.
  - üí°Ô∏è For improved performance, alerting could be moved to an asynchronous background task, but this was omitted to
    keep
    the solution simple.

        "battery_threshold": 20
      }'
  ```

  ```shell
  grpcurl -plaintext \
      -d '{
        "device_id":             "d-123",
        "temperature_threshold": 45.85,
        "battery_threshold":     20
      }' \
      localhost:8080 iot.v1.DeviceService/ConfigureDevice
  ```

### Record device metric

Records a device metric and triggers an alert if it breaches configured thresholds.

- **REST:** `POST /devices/:device_id/config`

  ```shell
  curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/devices/d-123/metrics \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "timestamp":  "2025-07-17T12:00:00Z",
        "temperature": 30.50,
        "battery":     10
      }'
  ```

- **gRPC:** `iot.v1.DeviceService/ConfigureDevice`

  ```shell
  grpcurl -plaintext \
      -d '{
        "device_id":  "d-123",
        "timestamp":  "2025-07-17T12:00:00Z",
        "temperature": 30.50,
        "battery":     10
      }' \
      localhost:8080 iot.v1.DeviceService/RecordMetric
  ```

### Get device alerts

Retrieves recent device alerts with support for timeframe filtering and cursor based pagination.

- **REST:** `POST /devices/:device_id/alerts`
  - Query params:

    | Name              | Example                                                               |
    |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `timeframe.start` | 2025-07-16T12:00:00Z                                                  |
    | `timeframe.end`   | 2025-07-18T12:00:00Z                                                  |
    | `page.size`       | 5 (default: 100)                                                      |
    | `page.token`      | `eyJMYXN0VGltZSI6IjIwMjUtMDQtMjVUMTI6MDA6MDBaIiwiTGFzdElEIjoxMTg5M30` |

  ```shell
  curl -i http://localhost:8080/devices/d-123/alerts? \
      timeframe.start=2025-07-16T12:00:00Z& \
      timeframe.end=2025-07-18T12:00:00Z& \
      page.size=5 \
    -H "Accept: application/json"
  ```

- **gRPC:** `iot.v1.DeviceService/GetDeviceAlerts`

  ```shell
  grpcurl -plaintext \
    -d '{
      "device_id":  "d-123",
      "timeframe":  {
        "start": "2025-07-16T12:00:00Z",
        "end":   "2025-07-18T12:00:00Z"
      },
      "page.size":  5,
      "page.token": ""
    }' \
    localhost:8080 iot.v1.DeviceService/GetDeviceAlerts
  ```

## Bonus Tasks

### Device rate limiting

- Device level rate limiting is enabled by default (5 requests every second).
- It can be disabled by uncommenting the `deviceRateLimit` section in `config.yaml`.
- The rate limiter is implemented as a middleware and allows each device to make up to `deviceRateLimit.tokens`
requests per `deviceRateLimit.seconds` seconds, across all APIs.
